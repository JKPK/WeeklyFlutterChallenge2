# WeeklyFlutterChallenge2
The aim of this weekly Flutter challenge is to learn to design and code Flutter UI.

This second challenge is focused on recreating Foxy weather app design created by Marta Więckowska:

What I have learned during this challenge (in no particular order):
1. [A new way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55294676/how-to-put-opacity-for-container-in-flutter) to add opacity to a color, by using ".withOpacity(0.5)". It's really useful.
2. A better understanding of [Animations](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations).
3. A better understanging of Widget life cycle methods: [initState and didChangeDependencies](https://flutterbyexample.com/stateful-widget-lifecycle/)
4. A better understanding of Layout.
5. [Using loop inside a collection](https://medium.com/flutter-community/whats-new-in-dart-2-3-1a7050e2408d).
6. A basic understanding of creating [Bézier Curves](https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/). I'd like to learn more about them, to seamlessly connect them.
7. A simple, yet useful [Divider](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Divider-class.html) widget.
8. Animated widgets like [AnimatedContainer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedContainer-class.html), [AnimatedPositioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPositioned-class.html), [AnimatedOpacity](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedOpacity-class.html).
9. Dealing with widgets that need to be outside the viewport, by using [Positioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html) widget inside a [Stack](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html) widget.
10. I have also refreshed some knowledge of GIMP to recreate the images, will surely prove useful in future challenges.
